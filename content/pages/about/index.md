# Welcome

I'm Memphis Marshall, a student studying computer science at Edith Cowan University. I also like security and enjoy CTFs and pentesting, plus researching and experimenting with new exploits. I also write a lot of open-source code because I rely a lot on other projects and want to allow others to do the same. I believe it's an important for programming to be accessible to all. My main languages are Rust, Python, JavaScript (node.js), and C++, but I like to experiment and occasionally use a lot more.
