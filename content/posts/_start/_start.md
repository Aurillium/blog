# Hello!

I've just set up this blog and I'm hoping to get some posts on it soon!

I was previously hoping to write my own simple blogging framework, but as a lot of articles have pointed out and I've come to realise over the last year or so: if you want to do more writing than fiddling with code, you're better off using a framework that's already out there, so I've chosen Hugo with the Stack theme. Over time I think the theme will diverge more and more to the point where it can't really be considered Stack anymore, but for now it's just a little different.

So this is the first post, not much more to say other than if you can see this, everything is working and that's great news!
